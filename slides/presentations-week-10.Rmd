### Exam recap

* Overall everyone did quite well!

* Many questions 100% correct

* A couple of items to highlight

### Exam recap

_A couple of items to highlight_

Which of the following is one use case for the kable package?

* To format tables included in RMarkdown documents and reports, (Correct answer) 56 %	
* To easily create plots of your data, (Incorrect answer)	6 %	
* To create a correlation matrix, (Incorrect answer) 6 %	
* To automatically calculate summary statistics for a data frame, (Incorrect answer) 31 %

### Exam recap

_A couple of items to highlight_

For this question, we use "left data frame" to refer to the first data frame passed to the join function, and "right data frame" to refer to the second data frame passed to the join function.

For example, below, df1 is the left data frame, and df2 is the right data frame.

left_join(df1, df2)

See here (and the slides) for a description of different joins: https://datascienceineducation.com/c07.html#joining-the-data

Which function would you use if you wanted to join the left and right data frame based on a key (a variable present in both data frames), joining those rows in the right data frame to those that match a key in the left data frame, and keeping all of the rows in the left data frame?

* anti_join() 0%
* left_join() (Correct answer) 63%
* right_join() 13%
* semi_join() 25%

### Exam recap

_A couple of items to highlight_

* mapping between data and geometric object 0%
* theme 0%
* data 38%
* geometric object 13%
* title (correct answer) 50%

### This week's topics

**Overview**

A. Final project presentations

B. A buffet of models

---

### A. Final project presentations

* Thank you for adding your ideas to the final project brainstorm! 

  * https://docs.google.com/presentation/u/3/d/1KWU5bhxZmV63vkNtQNxHo-2YI_iYJmSW2oOZ_jtFeP0/edit#slide=id.p

* Today, each of you will briefly (1 min. or less) present on your final project idea

* We will each provide feedback via Jamboard
  * https://jamboard.google.com/d/1S6K3ED_jvCS5b-GP3wfk5S3o6g4Buj0wgq6fTlmUY2w/edit?usp=sharing

### B. A buffet of models

There are a number of ways to understand variables about which you have data and the
relationships between them.

One way is to create a **model**, a simplified _representation_ of your data that
can be informative to you (and others) about your data - and, maybe, what your data
represents. 

From this broad definition, models can take many different forms:

- A sample statistic (e.g., a _mean_ of a variable)
- A relationship describing how two variables co-vary (e.g., a bivariate _correlation_)
- A linear regression model
- . . . (what models are common in your field?)

---

### B. A buffet of models

One of the benefits of modeling your data within R is that many R packages share a 
common modeling syntax, or interface: the formula syntax.

This code represents the regression of `hp` upon `mpg`:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
mpg ~ hp
```

This code often corresponds to the underlying mathematical/statistical equation:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
m1 <- lm(mpg ~ hp, data = mtcars)
equatiomatic::extract_eq(m1)
```

---

### B. A buffet of models

Today, we'll focus on the linear regression model, but will also touch on the following:

- *t*-test
- ANOVA
- generalized linear model (i.e., Poisson or Logistic Regression)
- multi-level (or hierarchical linear) model

---

### B. A buffet of models

There is a _lot_ we can do with a linear regression model!

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
d <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/data-edu/dataedu/master/data-raw/wt01_online-science-motivation/processed/sci_mo_processed.csv")

d
```

---

### B. A buffet of models

Estimating a model; seeing the result:

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
lm(FinalGradeCEMS ~ TimeSpent_hours, data = d)
```
---

### B. A buffet of models

Saving the output to an _object_ and printing a summary of the results

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
m1 <- lm(FinalGradeCEMS ~ TimeSpent_hours, data = d)
summary(m1)
```

---

### B. A buffet of models

Making the model more complex - a multiple regression

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
m2 <- lm(FinalGradeCEMS ~ TimeSpent_hours + int + Gender, data = d)
summary(m2)
```

---

### B. A buffet of models

Adding an interaction 

```{r, warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
m3 <- lm(FinalGradeCEMS ~ TimeSpent_hours + int*Gender, data = d)
summary(m3)
```

---

### B. A buffet of models

*t*-test

```{r}
m_t_test <- t.test(FinalGradeCEMS ~ Gender, data = d)
m_t_test
```

---

### B. A buffet of models

ANOVA

```{r}
m_anova <- aov(FinalGradeCEMS ~ subject, data = d)
m_anova
```

---

### B. A buffet of models

Multi-level model

```{r}
library(lme4)
m5 <- lmer(FinalGradeCEMS ~ TimeSpent_hours + int*Gender + (1|course_id), data = d)
summary(m5)
```

---

### Live coding

Let's head over to the following file for a demonstration: `week-10-demo.R`

* Readings:
  * https://datascienceineducation.com/c09.html
  * https://moderndive.com/5-regression.html
---

# Final Project

* [Final project](https://making-data-science-count.github.io/s21-intro-to-data-sci-methods-in-ed/assignments-final-projects.html)
  * Flesh out final project idea based upon feedback (this forthcoming week)
    * Then receive feedback from us (the following week)

---

### Random

* Do you have an interest in a class on social network analysis (more of a general theoretical and methodological approach that can be brought to bear on the analysis of face-to-face and digital networks) and the analysis of social media data? If so, please let us know.

* Are you interested in a graduate-level certificate in educational data science?
