# Getting to know one another

## Breakout rooms!

Starting with whomever had a snack or meal most recently, discuss . . . 

1. What is something you're good at but don't particularly like to do?
1. What is something you like to do but aren't particularly good at?
1. Why are you interested in data science?

# Course Information

## Course FAQ

.pull-left-wide[
**Q - What data science background does this course assume?**  
A - None.

**Q - Is this an intro stat course?**  
A - While statistics `\(\ne\)` data science, they are very closely related and have tremendous of overlap. Hence, this course is a great way to get started with statistics. However this course is *not* your typical high school statistics course.

**Q - Will we be doing computing?**   
A - Yes.

## Course FAQ

.pull-left-wide[
**Q - Is this an intro CS course?**  
A - No, but many themes are shared.

**Q - What computing language will we learn?**  
A - R.

**Q: Why not python?**  
A: We can discuss that over coffee. (but short answer, it's doesn't have the data science functionality that R has, natively and through packages)

# What we learned from your survey responses (thank you!)

- Everyone uses spreadsheet software
- You're (mostly) confident that you can solve problems with respect to analyzing 
data, but are less confident with respect to using statistical software
- Most of you have used data analysis notebooks (RMarkdown?)
- You have impressive backgrounds and professional experiences
- For many, programming and using statistics correctly can be intimidating
- You're a bit more interested in preparing data for analyses than we thought (cool!)

---

# Objectives

By the end of the session, participants will be able to:

1. Develop confidence going forward in you ability to analyze data as a part of your program
1. Be able to visualize educational data.
1. Use linear (regression) models as a general-purpose tool for data analysis.
1. Explore some of the more data science-related aspects of R through text analysis

---

# Pedagogical framework

*Constructivist*

You'll be involved in the process of building new capabilities (and knowledge and skills) with support from others and carefully-chosen scaffolds.

1. Each of the four sessions will be organized around a big idea
1. You will be doing a great deal of the work
1. Then, we will discuss what we did and how it applies

---

# Over-arching design

The pedagogical framework *plays out* in the following specific ways:

1. You'll first see some brief examples to give you a sense of what's possible
1. You'll be using R Markdown to try things out
1. You'll have a chance to share your ideas and thoughts about what you've done; it will also give me a chance to hear from you about what you did

---

# Agenda

### *Part 1: Getting up and running*
### Part 2: Visualizing and exploring data
### Part 3: Modeling and understanding data
### Part 4: Doing more with data science

# Background on R and RStudio

---

# A little motivation theory

## Expectancy-value theory

- We choose things that we are *confident* that we can do well and that are *valuable* to us

- We do these in a sociocultural *context*: our sense of belonging impacts what we choose to do

---

# An argument about RMarkdown

- This presentation will make the argument that **you can use R and RStudio to solve
problems that are important to you**

- In doing so, you can **participate in a cool community of data scientists in education**

---

# Why learn R?

* It is capable of carrying out basic and complex statistical analyses
* It is able to work with data small (*n* = 30) and large (*n* = 100,000+) efficiently
* It is a programming language and so is quite flexible
* There is a great, inclusive community of users and developers (and teachers)
* It is increasingly used in education
* It can help you to carry out your educational analyses in open and trustworthy ways
* It is cross-platform, open-source, and freely-available

# Where You'll Be Running R

RStudio Cloud (preferred)  
OR  
R and RStudio on your computer  

---

# RStudio Cloud

**[This link will take you to the RStudio Cloud project for this part of the session](https://rstudio.cloud/project/964811).**

Link also here: https://rstudio.cloud/project/964811

Once you have navigated to this webpage, log in using a Google or GitHub account. Then, create a permanent copy of the project in your own workspace (see the prompt at the top of the page guiding you to do this).

From here, you can write and run R code exactly as your would through RStudio on your computer.
---

# R and RStudio

**If you like, you may (of course!) use R and RStudio**

To download R:
* [Visit this page to download R](https://cran.r-project.org/)
* Find your operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
* Download the 'latest release' on the page for your operating system and download and install the application

To download RStudio:
* [Visit this page to download RStudio](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
* Find your operating system (Mac, Windows, or Linux)
* Download the 'latest release' on the page for your operating system and download and install the application

# Try it out! Getting started with RStudio

Activities:  

Running a single RMarkdown chunk  
Running another RMarkdown chunk  
Rendering an RMarkdown document to a PDF  
Creating your first visualization

---

# RMarkdown

* RMarkdown is a data analysis "notebook" that combines text with code and output
* It is a great file type to use when beginning to use R and to create reproducible analyses
* It is fun to use because you can generate different types of output (Word, PDF, and even web-based)

# Running a single RMarkdown chunk 

Let's hop over to the "demo doc" for part 1!

[`demo-doc-1-setting-up.Rmd`](demo-doc-1-setting-up.Rmd)

Let's run the first chunk by clicking the green arrow in the first code chunk.

If you saw the message "It worked!", congratulations - it worked!

---

# Running another RMarkdown chunk  

After running one chunk, we can easily run the next chunk. 

What happens when you print the second chunk (with `sci_mo_processed`)?

---

# Working through the remainder of the document

(We'll work together through a few sections of the document in this phase)

---

# Rendering an RMarkdown document to a PDF  

Have you made it to the end of the document? 

Now, we'll render to a PDF.
