- An overview of your work (especially your research) and what kinds of data you use in it
- Why data ethics can matter where it comes to your work
- What principles (three or more) you wish to aspire to in your data analysis and data science-related work (for examples, consider the seven core principles from the Data Femgit inism, c1 reading, as well as the optional resources/resources); consider principles that outline what you will do as well as what you will not do (see Manifest-No for refusals of specific kinds of data practices)
- Include three or more citations to publications or other resources (websites are okay); these can include any of the above resources as well as others that you identify or those with which you are already familiar
