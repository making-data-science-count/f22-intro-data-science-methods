## Financial Analysis Package, data access and cool graphs

Link to resource: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/quantmod/index.html

Mason Boyd 

### What this resource is

- Quantmod is a package that makes analyzing financial information easier in R. First of all, it allows you to pull financial information straight form Yahoo finance. This data is already in a time series format, which means that it doesn't need to be converted. That's helpful so that you can do further analysis or plotting for time series data. This package also includes some different financial plots, one of which look like it can do a normal line chart of stock data (this can be open, close, high, or low data), but it can also add what looks to be like a kernal density plot line as well. The kernal density allows you to see the trajectory of the stock a little more clearly. 

### Who will find this resource helpful

- Anyone interested in examining financial data in R will find this useful. Using the quantmod package was not difficult at all and it makes access and analyzing data really simple. The complicated R comes when you try to do deeper analyses on stock data, including forecasting. 

### Advice on how to use

- Honestly, I have read so many sources about how to use quantmod. Specifically, I looked up the correct code to use the getSymbols function that allows you to pull the data, as well as how to correctly structure the beginning date you want to pull the data from. Also, just google some of the graphs that you can use using the quantmod packages. You will find tons of resources and it appears to be a really popular package. 

## Bone Mineral Density measurements of common North American taxa, and Statistics for Archaeologists

Link to resources: Journal of Archaeological Science (2001) 28, 817â€“832
doi:10.1006/jasc.2000.0600, available online at http://www.idealibrary.com

Intertaxonomic Variability in Patterns of Bone Density and the Differential Representationof Bovid, Cervid, and Equid Elements in the Archaeological RecordAuthor(s): Y. M. Lam, Xingbin Chen, O. M. PearsonSource: American Antiquity, Vol. 64, No. 2 (Apr., 1999), pp. 343-362Published by: Society for American ArchaeologyStable URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/2694283Accessed

[Matt Hoover]

### What this resource is

- These resources are two zooarchaeological reports, one authored by Frank J. Dirrigl, Jr. and the other by Y.M. Lam, Xingbin Chen, and O.M. Pearson, that analyzed the bone mineral densities of 'gallinaceous' birds and a selection of bovids, cervids, and equids, respectively. The former used a DEXA (dual energy X-ray bone densitometer) and the latter used a CT scanner to derive bone mineral density calculations for their selected taxa. I used these measurements in my final report as comparative specimens; they were incredibly helpful because they went into great detail about how the measurements were derived, and made anayalzying fragemented bones possible due to the fact that mutiple scan sites were measured across one bone.

The third link is a collection of resoruces, collected by Professor David L. Carlson at TAMU, for arcaheologists concerning how to download R and then how to use its statistical packages for arcaheological research. I perused this a bit and it helped me wrap my head around the analyses going on in the first two reports about bone mineral density.

### Who will find this resource helpful

- Zooarchaeologists who are doing similar studies on survivorship of faunal remains would find these reosurces helpful. I relaize it is a very niche audience, but R has become very popular within various specialities of archaeology as a data viz, data analysis, and mapping tool due to its 'open source nature'; having relaible datasets such as these readily available on GitHub without having to hunt through the vast academic literature would be very helpful for said researchers.

### Advice on how to use

- The tables and diagrams in the reports are fairly starightforward; they provide illustrations of each element with the various scan sites depicted, and then provide tables gving the bone mineral densities of each scan site. Multiple 'types' of density measurements are provided, but the best/most useful measurement is pointed out for sake of convenience. 
- The resources collected by Prof. Carlson are excellent guides for getting started doing analyses in R similar to what this class did, albeit aimed at archaeology instead of education. These resources provide examples of datasets used by archaeologists in R, which is helpful in that a student would not have to hunt down or create their own dataset (like I did!).

Esther Michela

### What this resource is

- The Tigris package helps you work with files after you download shapefiles from the US census as sf objects, which means they are very detailed, accurate, and inclusive for all US states and territories. You can select specific regions, or states, counties to use, which makes it nice if you need a large or small area for a map.

### Who will find this resource helpful

- This will be a helpful tool for anyone looking to map data related to the United States. It gives you access to complete data on US territories that can be plotted on using latitude and longitudinal data. 

### Advice on how to use
- To download the shape files, use
- 'download.file("http://www2.census.gov/geo/tiger/GENZ2015/shp/cb_2015_us_state_20m.zip", destfile = "states.zip")
- 'unzip("states.zip")'
- Tigris works well with ggplot2, so it should be fairly straightforward to work with in terms of layering points, titles, etc. It may be a little hard to install as normal, so use 'devtools::install_github('walkerke/tigris')' if it's not working.

### Who will find this resource helpful

- UCLA's IDRE holds many seminars, textbooks, and even consulting. Their tutorial pages in particular range from beginner to advanced.

### Advice on how to use

- Throughout the semester, when googling problems, this would typically be the first website to pop up. Only later did I go to the home page and realize they have materials for all kinds of statistical software and even webinars. During the final project, I needed to know how to bold and italicize text and the first page I found detailing this process was an introduction to RMarkdown basics: http://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/rmarkdown/rmarkdown_seminar_flat.html.

- Even though my project did not require all aspects of this specific mapping resource, I found it most helpful to walk through the entire document and complete each step. This allowed me to familiarize myself with the packages and built my confidence for when it came time to execute my actual project. Extra practice is always useful. Here is  additional links that was also helpful for creating maps in R: https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/adv-map.html;http://www.nickeubank.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/RGIS3_MakingMaps_part1_mappingVectorData.html.  

### Who will find this resource helpful

- This resource is for someone who only has basic R skills/knowledge. This package uses spatial data (i.e., longitude and latitude coordinates) to build maps. The ggplot2 and ggmap packages allows users to make a variety of maps, from simple to complex. 
- It's succinct but has quite a bit of information; I would recommend completing each step to build confidence with ggplot and ggmaps.
